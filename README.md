Users can search for a specific item or scan a barcode, and the application will provide real-time price comparisons from various online retailers or local stores. This feature empowers users to make informed purchasing decisions and find the best deals available.
- **Lens/Scan Feature**: Implement a lens/scan feature that allows users to capture and extract expense information directly from bills or receipts.
